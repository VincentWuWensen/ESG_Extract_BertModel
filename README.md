# ESG_Extract_BertModel
These are two models extracted from the company's annual report that are related to keywords: the embedding model and the generative AI model. We provide an example of extracting Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 carbon footprints, as well as their climate measures, from Tencent's ESG report. The embedding model calculates the cosine similarity between the content in the report and the keywords, and uses the rerank model for reordering. The generative AI model is the Qwen2.5-0.5B, which captures the most relevant content related to the keywords through prompt engineering. In the generative AI model, the results from the first line are allowed to serve as learning samples for the AI, which enhances its understanding of user needs. We encourage the use of other AI models, such as Llama2 or Qwen2.5-7B, but need to consider inference speed. This will enable the model to analyze reports in both Chinese and English and extract key financial and ESG information from the reports.
